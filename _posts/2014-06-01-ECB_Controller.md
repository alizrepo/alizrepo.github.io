A rail eddy current brake (ECB) controller is proposed to produce the optimum braking and attractive forces using the variation of the reference current according to the speed. To improve the operation of the ECB, an optimal design of the controller is carried out by means of finite element method. Kriging method is utilised to reduce the computational costs. Additionally, the genetic algorithm is used as a multiobjective optimisation method to find the optimum current references in different speeds.
