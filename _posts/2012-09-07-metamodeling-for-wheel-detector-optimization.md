The purpose of this work is to improve the detection capability of train wheel detectors, by installing them in the optimal orientation and position, using finite element modeling (FEM) in combination with metamodeling techniques. The authors compare three common metamodeling techniques for the special case of wheel detector orientation: response surface methodology; multivariate adaptive regression splines; and kriging.
