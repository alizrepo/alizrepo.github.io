I am a Senior Research Engineer with more than 7 years of experience in
- algorithm development and data engineering across academic and industry 
- conducting high-quality research and providing technical leadership and supervision.
- translational research and collaboration with external partners such as universities, industry, and hospitals.
- AI and ML.
- system behaviour modelling and condition monitoring processes.
- algorithm development, simulation, computational and design software packages such as Matlab, Python, ANSYS Maxwell, HFSS, CST Microwave Studio.
- delivering several innovative engineering solutions by leading the design, research, and planning of projects.
- identifyinh and effectively solving challenging problems (e.g., successfully identified the root cause of several issues on state-of-the-art medical imaging systems, and railway control systems such as wheel detector, rail eddy current brake control systems, and proposed suitable design changes or system modifications to achieve optimal operational solutions).
